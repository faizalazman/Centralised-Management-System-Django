# Centralized Management System Django

This is a centralized file and document management system built with Django developed for my company, Lembaga Air Perak as a side project.

**DISCLAIMERS : NO REAL DATA OR FILE NAME ARE BEING USED, EVERTYHING IS RANDOMLY GENERATED**
Live version is [here](https://faizalazman.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Problem Statements
### Management
- The management department is having a problem tracking the movement of files and document. Most files aren't being collected at the right time causing problems finding them when they are needed. Files are being kept by their designated officer sometimes for months due to the lack of documentation and overdue alert.

### Laboratory
- Lab filing system is hard to sift through and sometimes they might be lost due to being misplaced.
- Ability to print out report.

## How this is fixed ?
**Data can be easily upload/downloaded from the database by the user to various file type such as csv , pdf and html.**
### Management
- Files are now being tracked electronically which allows overdue alerts to be easily monitored.
- Files status are being presented to the user using a table, which is ordered by their overdue status, which allows the user to take actions.

### Laboratory
- Extend the same system to allow report to being kept electronically and downloaded/printed by the user.
- Users are now able to print report
